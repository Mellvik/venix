# Installing Venix 86R 2.0 in MESS

This documents how to install Venix 86R in MESS running the Rainbow
emulation. You're on your own to get mame/mess, as well as translating
the keys to your variant.

## TL;DR Version

1. Install the hard drive / create the virtual hard drive
1. Low level format and partition the drive with wutil
1. Boot the Venix Boston Software Works extraction disk (vbswx1.img)
1. Partition the drive (again) as guided
1. Feed the floppys
1. Reboot (I forget, do I need to redo the bootable stuff with wutil here?)
1. Profit! You have a Venix 86R 2.0 BSW Edition system
