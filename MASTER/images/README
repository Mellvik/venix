These files are dd-copies of the physical Venix diskettes, all 360KB diskettes. The content is tar formatted, but the sector mapping is odd, and not readily readable. Use the extrated tar files instead.
If you need to create physical (or virtual) disettes, the dd-files are your friends. Be aware though that you need to do sector remapping if you're not using 360kb diskettes. More about that later, there is a utility to do that.
