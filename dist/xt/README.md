This directory contains the raw floppies from Venix. The images are in
'physical' order, not the logical order that you'll sometimes
see. They have been compressed with xz. They don't use teledisk.

The BACKUP disks are 1.2MB floppies, while the XFER.IMG is a 360k
floppy.

This is an image of an installed system. You can restore it by booting
XFER.IMG to a suitable disk.

After the first disk, they are all uncompressed tar balls, but Venix
has a weird interleave.
